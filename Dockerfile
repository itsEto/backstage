# The purpose of this image is to serve the frontend app content separately.
# By default the Backstage backend uses the app-backend plugin to serve the
# app from the backend itself, but it may be desirable to move the frontend
# content serving to a separate deployment, in which case this image can be used.

# This dockerfile requires the app to be built on the host first, as it
# simply copies in the build output into the image.

# The safest way to build this image is to use `yarn docker-build:app`
